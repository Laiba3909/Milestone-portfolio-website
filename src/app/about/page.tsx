</span> <br />

I started with dreams of working in healthcare, imagining a future in the medical world. Back then, whenever I saw websites, I thought they were probably made in something like Word or Excel!ðŸ˜… But when I got curious and started learning web development, I discovered it was a whole new world of creativity and logic.
<br />
<span className="text-[#deab7f]">Diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </span>opened up endless possibilities for bringing ideas to life online. Now, coding isn&apos;t just a skillâ€”it&apos;s my passion. I&apos;m excited to keep growing and creating, one line of code at a time, on this unexpected but thrilling journey.

One of my dreams is to use my skills to support local talent. Many talented house painters work hard on the streets, relying on passersby to notice them. I want to build a platform where they can showcase their work, experience, and direct contact details, all in one place. Imagine a space where homeowners can find trustworthy painters, see their work history, and contact them without leaving home. It might not be a guaranteed success, but I am excited to try - every step is worth it if it helps even a few artists connect with clients from the comfort of their homes.
